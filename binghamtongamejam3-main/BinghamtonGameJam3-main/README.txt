Binghamton GameJam Ideas sheet
CASINO THEME!!!! (maybe)
Binding of Issac type of game focusing on having 12 items that get sacrificing items on the completion of the room.
You have to pick 1 out of the 3 items to sacrifice and one of the other 2 gets upgraded.
Enemies will probably start spawned on entry of room to mitigate having to deal with enemy spawns

When leaving a room a menu will pop up asking the player what item they would like to sacrifice
